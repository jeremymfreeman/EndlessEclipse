# Visual Game Design ‚Äì Roguelike Survival Game

## Overview  
This project was created as part of **Engineering 101 (Freshman Year Project)** at California Baptist University.  
Our team of three students was tasked with designing and building a fully playable video game from scratch.  

The final product is a **top-down, roguelike survival game** inspired by *Vampire Survivors*. Players must survive against waves of spawning enemies for as long as possible, with difficulty scaling over time as spawn rates and enemy movement speeds increase.
